### Manual Installation 🛠
Classic userChrome installation for Firefox CSS themes.
- Installable on all editions of Firefox (and forks).
- Configuration is handled in `about:config`.
- No auto-updates; you'll have to manually update the theme.

Open `about:config` and set:
| Pref | Value | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` | `true` (boolean) | Enables [userChrome](https://www.userchrome.org/) customization. |
| `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` | `true` (boolean) | Required for proper icon colors. |
| `browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.logowordmark.alwaysVisible` | `false` (boolean) | Reverts the new tab Firefox logo behavior to what it was in Photon. |
| `browser.urlbar.scotchBonnet.enableOverride` | `false` (boolean) | Disables the new dropdown-style searchmode picker. |
| `widget.windows.mica.popups` | `0` (number) | (Windows only) Disables transparency effects on menus. |
<details>
	<summary>For Firefox 121 and below...</summary>
	
| Pref | Value | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` | `true` (boolean) | **Only for Firefox 121 and below.**<br>Required for some functionality to work. |
| `layout.css.nesting.enabled` | `true` (boolean) | **Only for Firefox 117 and below.**<br>Required for theming and some other stuff to work. |
</details>

Optionally, you can set:
| Pref | Value | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `security.secure_connection_icon_color_gray` | `true` (boolean) | Makes the connection icon gray instead of green.<br>Defaults to `true` in later versions of Photon. |
____
Too lazy to set all these prefs? You can visit https://zapsnh.github.io/zcpt-configurator/, enable `Include preferences for theme installation` (and maybe customize the theme a bit), and click `Export Options` to generate a `user.js` file that you can put in your profile folder.

**Make sure to delete the `user.js` file after you start Firefox so that it doesn't override any changes you make in `about:config`.**

Extract the zip and move `zapsCoolPhotonTheme-*` (where `*` is `main`, `128esr`, etc.) to your profile folder. You can find this by going to `about:support` and opening your profile folder/directory.

Rename the `zapsCoolPhotonTheme-*` folder to `chrome`

Your directory structure should look like this:
* `Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile_name_here` > `chrome` > `userChrome.css` and others

and **not** like this:
* `Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile_name_here` > `chrome` > `zapsCoolPhotonTheme-*` > `userChrome.css` and others

Restart Firefox.

You're done! 🎉

____
### Sine Mod Manager 🪐
Uses the Sine Mod Manager to install the theme.
- Installable on all editions of Firefox (and forks).
- Has auto-updating (?) and a basic configurator.

Install the Sine theme manager for your browser. ([follow this guide](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-installation))

You can get this theme by searching for it (zap's cool photon theme) in Sine's marketplace and installing it.

If you want to specify a version of this theme to install, in the local installation text box, then type in this repo, and optionally [the branch](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/branches) (e.g. `zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/tree/128esr` for the version for FF 128), and install it there.

You're done! 🎉
____
### Extension 🧩
Install the theme as an extension (like uBlock and the like).
- Only installable on Firefox Developer Edition, Firefox Nightly, and Firefox ESR (and forks based on these versions) since **you need to disable extension signing** (which is insecure).
- Has auto-updating and a built-in configurator.

This version is based on [Paxmod](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod).

Open `about:config` and set:
| Pref | Value | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `extensions.experiments.enabled`  | `true` (boolean) | Enables extensions experiments which allows CSS theming in extensions. |
| `xpinstall.signatures.required` | `false` (boolean) | Disables extension signing which may be insecure. See [this](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod#why-cant-i-install-paxmod-as-a-verified-extension-through-mozilla) for the reason.  |
  
All other preferences required to run the theme (see [the table above](#manual-installation-)) will be set automatically.

Download the release for your browser version:
| Browser Version | Extension Version |
|:-:|:-:|
| 140+ | [Latest Version](https://github.com/zapSNH/zcpt-webextension/releases/latest) |
| 128 - 139 | [v144.2.0](https://github.com/zapSNH/zcpt-webextension/releases/v144.2.0) |
| 115 - 127 | [v0.24.5](https://github.com/zapSNH/zcpt-webextension/releases/tag/v0.24.5) |

More info at: https://github.com/zapSNH/zcpt-webextension/blob/main/README.md

You're done! 🎉

### Git :octocat: 
<!-- yes i know that the github != git shut hell up -->
Uses `git` . Recommended for people who know what they're doing.
- Installable on all editions of Firefox.
- Configuration is handled in `about:config`.
- There is no auto-updating (unless you make a script for that) but you can quickly update using `git pull` in your terminal.

Open `about:config` and set the same prefs in the [Manual](#manual-installation-) installation.

Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you haven't already.

Open your profile folder which you can find by going to `about:support` and opening your profile folder/directory.

If you're using a file manager with a GUI (Explorer, Finder, etc.), open a terminal in the profile folder, usually by right clicking and clicking Open in Terminal (or similar). [(example)](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/assets/134786889/c35ffc7d-0343-479a-9366-72d56833c4c3)

Copy (or type) this command into the terminal `git clone https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme.git chrome` and press enter. **Make sure the terminal's directory is the profile folder (like `Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile_name_here`) and not any of its subfolders.**

If you're using a version of Firefox that isn't the latest stable version then copy (or type) these commands into the terminal.
```
cd chrome
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
where `BRANCH_NAME` is [your Firefox version (i.e. `115esr` or `nightly`)](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/branches). (don't use the ones prefixed by `webextension`)

You're done! 🎉

# Forks 🍴
If you're using a Firefox fork (e.g. Waterfox, Floorp, etc.), you can set these prefs in `about:config` for theme fixes and adjustments for your browser.

It is recommended to disable any custom UI styles set by the browser to prevent conflicts.

*(these values should be booleans)*
| Pref | Value | Browser |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `uc.waterfox` | `true` | Waterfox |
| `uc.floorp` | `true` | Floorp |
| `uc.librewolf` | `true` | LibreWolf |
| `uc.tor` | `true` | Tor Browser |
| `uc.mullvad` | `true` | Mullvad Browser |

# Configuration
You can view all of the config options at the [Wiki](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/wiki/Config-Options).

An interactive configurator is available at https://zapsnh.github.io/zcpt-configurator/. To apply the settings, place the exported `user.js` file in your profile folder/directory (`Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile`, not in the `chrome` folder), launch Firefox, and then **delete the `user.js` file afterwards.**

For the WebExtension version, the configurator can be found in the extension's options page (`about:addons` > zap's cool photon theme > Preferences/Options). The settings will apply after you click `Apply` (unless you're 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂).

## Miscellaneous
Firefox Photon icons are primarily taken from Firefox 87 or Firefox 78esr.
Other icons not present originally in Firefox Photon have been recreated based on their Proton/Acorn counterparts.
