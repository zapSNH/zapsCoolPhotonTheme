____
Too lazy to set all these prefs? You can visit https://zapsnh.github.io/zcpt-configurator/, enable `Include preferences for theme installation` (and maybe customize the theme a bit), and click `Export Options` to generate a `user.js` file that you can put in your profile folder.

**Make sure to delete the `user.js` file after you start Firefox so that it doesn't override any changes you make in `about:config`.**

Extract the zip and move `zapsCoolPhotonTheme-*` (where `*` is `main`, `128esr`, etc.) to your profile folder which you can find by going to `about:support` and opening your profile folder/directory.

Rename the `zapsCoolPhotonTheme-*` folder to `chrome`

Make sure the directory is like this:
* `Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile_name_here` > `chrome` > `userChrome.css` and others

and **not** like this:
* `Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile_name_here` > `chrome` > `zapsCoolPhotonTheme-*` > `userChrome.css` and others

Restart Firefox.

You're done! üéâ

### Extension üß©
Only installable on Firefox Developer Edition, Firefox Nightly, and Firefox ESR (and forks based on these versions) since **you need to disable extension signing** (which may be insecure).

Has auto-updating and a built-in configurator.
This version is based on [Paxmod](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod).

Open `about:config` and set:
| Pref | Value | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `extensions.experiments.enabled`  | `true` | Enables extensions experiments which allows CSS theming in extensions. |
| `xpinstall.signatures.required` | `false` | Disables extension signing which may be insecure. See [this](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod#why-cant-i-install-paxmod-as-a-verified-extension-through-mozilla) for the reason.  |
  
All other preferences required to run the theme (see [the table above](#manual-installation-)) will be set automatically.

Download the release for your browser version:
| Browser Version | Extension Version |
|:-:|:-:|
| 128+ | [Latest Version](https://github.com/zapSNH/zcpt-webextension/releases/latest) |
| 115 - 127 | [v0.24.5](https://github.com/zapSNH/zcpt-webextension/releases/tag/v0.24.5) |

### Git :octocat: 
<!-- yes i know that the github != git just shut up -->
Recommended for people who know what they're doing.

Installable on all editions of Firefox. Configuration is handled in `about:config`. There is no auto-updating (unless you make a script for that) but you can quickly update using `git pull` in your terminal.

Open `about:config` and set the same prefs in the [Manual](#manually-) installation.

Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you haven't already.

Open your profile folder which you can find by going to `about:support` and opening your profile folder/directory.

If you're in a file manager with a GUI (Explorer, Finder, etc.), open a terminal in the profile folder, usually by right clicking and clicking Open in Terminal (or similar). [(example)](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/assets/134786889/c35ffc7d-0343-479a-9366-72d56833c4c3)

Copy (or type) this command into the terminal `git clone https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme.git chrome` and press enter. **Make sure the terminal is in the profile folder (like `Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile_name_here`) and not in any of its subfolders.**

If you're using a version of Firefox that isn't the latest stable version then copy (or type) these commands into the terminal.
```
cd chrome
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
where `BRANCH_NAME` is [your Firefox version (i.e. `115esr` or `nightly`)](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/branches). (don't use the ones prefixed by `webextension`)

You're done! üéâ

# Forks üç¥
If you're using a Firefox fork (e.g. Waterfox, Floorp, etc.), you can set these prefs in `about:config` for theme fixes and adjustments for your browser.

It is recommended to disable any UI styles set by the browser to prevent conflicts.
| Pref | Value | Browser |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `uc.waterfox` | `true` | Waterfox |
| `uc.floorp` | `true` | Floorp |
| `uc.librewolf` | `true` | LibreWolf |
| `uc.tor` | `true` | Tor Browser |

# Configuration
Config options are available at the [Wiki](https://github.com/zapSNH/zapsCoolPhotonTheme/wiki/Config-Options).

An interactive configurator is available at https://zapsnh.github.io/zcpt-configurator/. To apply the settings, place the exported `user.js` file in your profile folder/directory (`Profiles` > `XXXXXXXX.profile`), launch Firefox, and then delete the `user.js` file afterwards.

For the WebExtension version, the configurator can be found in the extension's option page (`about:addons` > zap's cool photon theme > Preferences/Options). The settings will apply after you click `Apply` (unless you're ùìØùìªùìÆùì™ùì¥ùîÇ).

## Miscellaneous
Firefox Photon icons are primarily taken from Firefox 87 or Firefox 78esr.
Other/newer icons not present in Firefox 87/78esr are primarily based on their Proton/Acorn counterparts.

- [YukisCoffee's Phroton](https://github.com/YukisCoffee/phroton-legacy/)
- The folks over at r/FirefoxCSS
- [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) since they made Firefox so customizable [and made Photon (but they also made Proton >:()]
